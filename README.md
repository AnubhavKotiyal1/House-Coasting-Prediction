**Usage:**

This dataset can be used for various machine learning tasks, including:

* **Regression:** Predict the housing price based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, etc.
* **Feature Engineering:** Explore and engineer new features from the existing data (e.g., create a new feature for "rooms" by combining bedrooms and bathrooms).
* **Data Visualization:** Create visualizations to understand the relationships between features and the target variable (e.g., scatter plots, histograms).

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
