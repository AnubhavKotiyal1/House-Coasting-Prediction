# Housing Cost Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict housing costs using a dataset of housing features. The model is trained on a dataset containing various attributes of houses and their corresponding prices. 

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is named `housing.csv`. This file includes the following features:

* **CRIM:** per capita crime rate by town.
* **ZN:** proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
* **INDUS:** proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
* **CHAS:** Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).
* **NOX:** nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).
* **RM:** average number of rooms per dwelling.
* **AGE:** proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
* **DIS:** weighted distances to five Boston employment centers.
* **RAD:** index of accessibility to radial highways.
* **TAX:** full-value property-tax rate per $10,000.
* **PTRATIO:** pupil-teacher ratio by town.
* **B:** 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town.
* **LSTAT:** % lower status of the population.
* **MEDV:** Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's.


## Model

A Linear Regression model was used to predict housing costs. You can find the model training code in the `Notebook.ipynb` file.

## Results

The model achieved the following performance metrics:

* **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** [MSE value]
* **R-squared (R2):** [R2 value]
